## About NURI

NURI (National Unified Climate Response and Disease Analysis With Prediction System) is an innovative system aimed at tackling health challenges in Indonesia related to climate change. By integrating artificial intelligence and big data, NURI forecasts potential increases in climate-related diseases using data from BMKG (climate), KLHK (pollution), and BPJS health data (from 2016-2023).

### Key Features

-   **Integrated Climate and Health Data**: Real-time data from multiple governmental sources.
-   **Disease Prediction Models**: Identifies and clusters diseases based on climate trends.
-   **Decision Support System**: Assists in proactive disease prevention and response.
-   **Real-time Analytics and Dashboard**: Provides insights and visualizations for stakeholders.

## Objectives

NURI aims to utilize artificial intelligence and big data to:

-   Analyze the relationship between climate and disease.
-   Develop predictive systems to support preventive health actions.
-   Provide data-driven insights to health institutions across Indonesia.

## Background

Indonesia, as a tropical archipelago, faces health challenges from climate change, including increases in infectious and non-infectious diseases. Unpredictable weather, temperature fluctuations, and irregular rainfall patterns contribute to the spread of diseases like dengue and respiratory infections. NURI bridges this gap by providing insights into these patterns, supporting effective health responses.

## Impact

NURI enhances the effectiveness of Indonesiaâ€™s climate-related disease prevention and management efforts. With data-driven insights, health institutions can take timely preventive actions, reduce the impact of diseases, and strengthen inter-agency collaboration, ultimately improving public health resilience.
